# Uber-Ride-Data-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Uber's rideshare data and leverage the skills of Matplotlib to perform visualization and analysis. 

## Objective 
This particular dataset included information such as city, city type, fare, driver count and etc. Thus objective was to find insights about distribution of drivers and variance in price in different parts of the city/conutry. 

## Approach 

    1. Data Cleaning
        - Check for empty columns 
        - Drop the empty columns 
        - Check for repeat values

    2. Perform Analysis 
        - Scatter Plot 
        - 3 Pie Charts

    3. Draw Conclusions 
        - Based on the analysis, summarize the conclusions. 

## Analysis & Metrics 

**Bubble Chart:** The point was to compare `Total Number of Rides per City`  against `Average Fare($)`. The bubbles were sized by the amount of drivers by the city. For a better categorization, the cities were grouped in to `Rural`,`Urban` and `Suburban`

**Pie Chart: % of Total Fares by City Type:** The point of this pie chart was to see the distribution of the `Total number of fares` by the city type. This indicates how many more rides and how expensive are they by `city types`.
